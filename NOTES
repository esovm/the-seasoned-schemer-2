The "rules"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Law of Car

    The primitive 'car' is defined only for non-empty lists.

The Law of Cdr

    The primitive 'cdr' is defined only for non-empty lists. The 'cdr'
    of any non-empty list is always another list.

The Law of Cons

    The primitive 'cons' takes two arguments. The second argument to
    cons must be a list. The result is a list.  (In most scheme
    implementations cons work also on sexp not only on [list-of
    sexp].)

The Law of Null?

    The primitive null? is defined only for lists. (In most scheme
    implementations null? works also on sexps not only on [list-of
    sexp].)

The Law of Eq?

    The primitive 'eq?' takes two arguments. Each must be a nonnumeric
    atom.


The Twenty Commandments
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The First Commandment

    When recurring on a list of atoms, 'lat', ask two questions about
    it: (null? lat) and *else*.  When recurring on a number, 'n', ask
    two questions about it: (zero? n) and else.  When recurring on a
    list of sexp, l, ask three question about it: (null? l), (atom?
    (car l)), and *else*.

The Second Commandment

    Use 'cons' to build lists.

The Third Commandment

    When building a list, describe the first typical element, and then
    cons it onto the natural recursion.

The Fourth Commandment

    Always change at least one argument while recurring. When
    recurring. When recurring on a list of atoms, 'lat', use (cdr
    lat). When recurring on a number, 'n', use (sub1 n). And when
    recurring on a list of S-expressions, 'l', use (car l) and (cdr l)
    if neither (null? l) nor (atom?  (car l)) are true.
    
    It must be changed to be closer to termination. The changing
    argument must be tested in the termination condition:
    - when using cdr, test termination with null? and
    - when using sub1, test termination with zero?.

The Fifth Commandment

    When building a value with 'o+', always use 0 for the value of the
    terminating line, for adding 0 does not change the value of an
    addition.  When building a value with 'o*', always use 1 for the
    value of the terminating line, for multiplying by 1 does not
    change the value of a multiplication.  When building a value with
    cons, always consider () for the value of the terminating line.

The Sixth Commandment

    Simplify only after the function is correct.

The Seventh Commandment

    Recur on the subparts that are of the same nature:
    - On the sublists of a list.
    - On the subexpressions of an arithmetic expression.

The Eighth Commandment

    Use help functions to abstract from representations.

The Ninth Commandment

    Abstract common patterns with a new function.

The Tenth Commandment

    Build functions to collect more than one value at a time.

The Eleventh Commandment

    Use additional arguments when a function needs to know what other
    arguments to the function have been like so far.

The Twelfth Commandment

    Use (letrec ...) to remove arguments that do not change for
    recursive applications.

The Fourteenth Commandment

    Use (call/cc ..) to return values abruptly and promptly

The Fifteenth Commandment

    Use (let ..) to name the values or repeated expressions in a
    function definition if they may be evaluated twice for one and the
    same use of the function. And use (let ...) to name the values of
    expressions (without set!) that are re-evaluated every time a
    function is used.

The Sixteenth Commandment

    Use (set! ...) only with names defined in (let...)s.

The Seventeenth Commandment

    Use (set! ...) for (let ((x ..)) ...) only if there is at least
    one (lambda ...) between it and the (let ((x ...)) ...), or if the
    new value for x is a function that refers to x. 

The Eighteenth Commandment

    Use (set! x ...) only when the value that x refers to is no longer needed.

The Nineteenth Commandment

    Use (set! ...) to remember valuable things between two distinct
    uses of a function.

The Twentieth Commandment

    When thinking about a value created with (letcc ...), write down
    the function that is equivalent but does not forget. Then, when
    you use it, remember to forget.
